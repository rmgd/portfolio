          <p>I am 31 years old and currently live in a developing town called Milton. I have worked in many industries, longest
            being finance for over 10 years in many levels with TD Canada Trust, Legal Aid Ontario, and most recently a non
            profit organization called Responsible Gambling Council. Travelling is my number one joy next to spending time
            with family and friends. My other interests are in humanitarian and charity work, self help and improvement and
            food. and empower your needs...through pure data analytics.</p>
          <br>
          <p>In the process and development of becoming a Full Stack Developer I have had many challanges and rewards. Coding
            has been a long learning process but an enjoying one. Take a look some of my efforts below.</p>
